# Gambling on Trump Tweets

Until June of 2020, on the website [predictit.org](https://predictit.org), one could
gamble on the number of tweets that [Donald Trump](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump),
the [whitehouse](https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse) or [POTUS](https://twitter.com/POTUS/)
twitter accounts would make over the course of a week.
My gut instinct tells me that this was an inefficient market, and that one could fit 
a distribution to his past tweets and then go from there.

**NOTE:** this will not work if you get it up and running, but I will leave it up as
a reference point.
